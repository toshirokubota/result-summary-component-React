## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
The content of the web page is populated dynamically from a JSON data file (However, the current version has JSON data pasted inside <script> area.)

### What I learned

In this project, I employed a mobile-first workflow. I first designed the mobile version, then used media query for a larger screen. 

I realized how hard it is to read a local static file (data.json) from my static web page. 

### Continued development

I have gotten somewhat better at controlling the layout of all the elements in the design. But I am still encounter cases where I am not sure why they show up in an unexpected way and how to fix it. So I need to keep working on it, eventually I will make it mine.

I want to be more comfortable with flexbox patterns and understand when to use the layout. 

I was able to populate the page with data.json, although I pasted the content of the file inside my script. I wanted to read it from a file, but I felt it was beyond the scope of this project.
