## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS/SASS
- React

### Continued development

This is my first project with React.js. I will keep practicing with it. 
I did not separate custome components into separate files. Just being lazy. No excuse...
